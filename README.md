# Final thesis in Upper Secondary School

This project contains the development of a 4 axis robotic arm programmed and designed nearly
from scratch, and will have the capability to write with a pen. The robot arm will be
controlled by a controller and should a have a graphical user interface (GUI), where you could
see the prototype working in real-time. The project also summarizes what I have learned
through these three years. The main goal for the project is to have a full working 4-axis robot
arm. Through the development the main purpose is to grow my experience with developing
robots and also get an upper high school examination. The most common technical pieces such as,
physics, computer aided design, mechatronics, electronics, microprocessors, mathematics
and a few steps through the process of developing a product will be included.

The project will be concluded with a presentation that will take place in May 2018.
